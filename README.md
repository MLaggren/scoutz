Documentation
-------------

`scoutz` is a Ruby on Rails V3 application for the management of BSA Scouting organizations. `scoutz` is in no way associated nor endorsed by the [Boy Scouts of America](http://www.scouting.org).

Install it, play with it, let me know what you think.

Coming: `scoutz` will be hosted on a live site, freely available to the interweb's cosmonauts.


Getting Started
---------------

It is assumed you have created and served a Rails application prior. If you have not, the official [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) would be a good place to start learning more.

Please note that `scoutz` was written with the intention of being hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). This includes:

* Assets hosted on a CDN, like [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* Served using [thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin)

------------

We love contributors! Please follow these simple guidelines:

1. Fork the [master branch](https://github.com/threadhead/scoutz/tree/master).
2. Make your changes in a topic branch.
3. Send a pull request.
